            <h3> <strong> Doctors share their experience of working tirelessly during the pandemic:</strong></h3>
            <p> 
                It’s been around one-and-a-half years since the Covid pandemic engulfed the whole country and no one
                knows when the virus will fade away. In these torrid times, our doctors have been serving day and 
                night, like the soldiers who guard our borders, to protect millions of lives.
                <br><br>
                From being witnesses to so many deaths around them to working tirelessly without a break to getting 
                themselves self-quarantined due to the fear of taking the virus home, the doctors were driven to the 
                breaking point many a times during the pandemic. It has been an emotionally and physically exhausting 
                journey for doctors – both at the personal and professional level.
            </p>
            <h3>Challenges galore</h3>
            <p> 
                The most challenging experience was the unavailability of necessary Covid medications like Remdesivir,
                oxygen cylinders, and to meet the mounting demands for hospital beds, particularly during the second
                wave that claimed lakhs of lives.
                <br><br>
                Sharing his experience, Dr Arunesh Kumar, Head, Pulmonology, Paras Hospitals, Gurugram, said: 
                “Convincing the attendant to procure the medicine from anywhere to save their loved ones was another 
                uphill task. The whole scenario in the hospital was much dreaded compared to the previous year.”
                <br><br>
                “Even getting a bed for his own friends and relatives was a major challenge, despite being a healthcare
                professional,” he said.
                <br><br>
                “We used to feel heavy from inside that we are not able to cater to needs of the society. It was one of
                the worst phases I have seen in my professional life,” Dr Kumar added.
                <br><br>
                Meanwhile, watching patients dying up close them and being in the constant grip of a whirlpool of 
                emotions was quite daunting. Dr Bhavika Bhat, a Mumbai-based ENT consultant, said the whole experience 
                was utterly soul-destroying. “We have seen numerous deaths right from our medical school in the ICUs and 
                the operation theatre. But I must admit that Covid deaths in isolation have been very disheartening for us
                doctors, too. These patients did not have any relatives by their side, which was traumatic for us also. 
                A feeling that plays on our mental psyche even now and also of the near and dear ones,” she added.
                <br><br>
                Bhat continued and said wearing PPE kits for 7-8 hours has also been quite a challenging task, particularly
                in summers when people feel uncomfortable even in masks. She also lamented about not being able to see 
                her parents for months altogether.
                <br><br>
                “There have been months together when I didn’t go to see my parents because of the constant fear of me 
                taking the virus home. After some surgeries I have had to self-quarantine myself in a room,” said Bhat. 
                She further said: “I had to perform many emergency surgeries without a Covid test report. The time till
                the report came was filled with anxiety and stress. I remember the time when I operated on a patient and 
                the next day, he tested positive, I had a full bag of emotions.”
